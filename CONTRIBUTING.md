# Contributing to the project

Thanks for offering to contribute to this project!

If you're looking to contribute a minor change (small bug fix, etc.) please go ahead and fork the repo and submit a pull request.

But if it's a larger feature, please first [open an issue](https://github.com/craigatk/opentelemetry-gradle-plugin/issues) for discussion.
With some upfront discussion we can reduce any potential risk of redesign/rework after you've already put in the work to make the large changes.

Thanks!
