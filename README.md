# Gradle OpenTelemetry build plugin

Find the slowest parts of your build with the Gradle OpenTelemetry build plugin. This plugin instruments your build
with OpenTelemetry traces and spans so you can visualize all tasks executed in your build, find where the build time is going, track build duration over time, etc.
You'll get a trace for each build with a span for every task, so you can find and optimize the bottlenecks in your build.

The plugin will also show you the test duration breakdown per test class and test case:

![Trace with spans per test](img/per-test-spans.png "Trace with spans per test")

And the plugin also attaches information about test failures so you can view those as well:

![Trace with failed test](img/test-failure.png "Trace with failed test")

The plugin will also log out the trace ID at the end of your build so you can easily find the exact trace for your build:

## OpenTelemetry spans and attributes

The plugin creates a single trace for each build, with an overall span for the build and child individual spans for each task.
The plugin also creates individual span for each test executed in a Gradle task with the `Test` type.

### Span attributes

The plugin adds the following attributes to the different spans it creates.

Root build span is named `${project.name}-build`, for example this plugin's root span is named `opentelemetry-gradle-plugin-build`
And the root span has the following attributes:

| Span attribute name | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `build.task.names`  | Tasks included in the Gradle command that ran the build. For example, if you ran `./gradlew test build` this attribute would be "test build" |
| `build.success`     | Whether the build succeeded or failed (boolean)                                                                                              |

All spans (root span, task spans, etc.) have the following attributes:

| Span attribute name | Description                                                                                                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `project.name`      | Name of the Gradle project                                                                                 |
| `gradle.version`    | Version of Gradle used to run the build                                                                    |
| `system.is_ci`      | Whether the build was run in a CI environment or not (checks for existence of a `CI` environment variable) |

Each task has a child span created from the root build.
The task spans are named with the task path, for example `:test`
And each task span has the following attributes:

| Span attribute name | Description                                                                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `task.name`         | Name of the task, e.g. `test`                                                     |
| `task.path`         | Full path to the task, including subproject names. E.g. `:app:test`               |
| `task.type`         | Full package and class name of the task, e.g. `org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test` |
| `task.outcome`      | Outcome of the task, e.g. `SUCCESS`, `UP-TO-DATE`, or `FROM-CACHE`                |
| `task.did_work`     | Whether the task did work (boolean)                                               |
| `error`             | `true` if the task failed                                                         |
| `error_message`     | If the task failed, the failure message                                           |
| `task.failed`       | Set to `true` if the task failed                                                  |
| `task.failure`      | If the task failed, the failure message                                           |

And finally the plugin creates a child span off each `Test` type task for each test executed.
The name of the per-test span is the full name of the test method.
And the attributes on the per-test spans are:

| Span attribute name       | Description                                                |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `test.result`             | Result of the test, e.g. `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`            |
| `error`                   | `true` if the test failed                                  |
| `error_message`           | If the test failed, the failure message                    |
| `test.failure.message`    | If the test failed, the failure message                    |
| `test.failure.stacktrace` | If the test failed, abbreviated stack trace of the failure |
| `task.name`               | Name of the task, e.g. `test`                              |

### Remote parent trace

Some CI execution systems such as Jenkins have support for creating a trace of the full CI execution,
where the Gradle build is just part of that whole execution.

Starting with plugin version `1.12.0`, the plugin will auto-detect these remote parent span and trace IDs
when they are passed in as environment variables and make the Gradle build part of that overall trace.

By default, the plugin uses parent environment variables named `SPAN_ID` and `TRACE_ID` - and those can be configured if
needed with plugin config parameters `parentSpanIdEnvVarName` and `parentTraceIdEnvVarName`.

### URL for viewing trace

Starting with plugin version `1.14.0`, you can specify the URL to view a trace in your OpenTelemetry backend
and the plugin will substitute the trace ID and print out a convenient URL to quickly view the trace in your telemetry UI.

For any OpenTelemetry backend, you can pass the `traceViewUrl` config parameter to specify the URL to view a trace with `{traceId}` in the place where the
plugin should substitute the trace ID for that build.

For example, for a local Jaeger instance with the UI running on port `16686`:

```groovy
openTelemetryBuild {
    endpoint = "http://localhost:4317"
    
    traceViewUrl = "http://localhost:16686/trace/{traceId}"
}
```

Then the plugin will print out the full URL to view the trace when the build completes:

```
OpenTelemetry build trace http://localhost:16686/trace/5a47e977c06a5d2a046d101fdedcb4ed
```

#### URLs for specific OpenTelemetry backends

As a convenience for known OpenTelemetry backends, you can specify the type of the backend with the `traceViewType` parameter
and then you only need to include the base URL for viewing traces:

```groovy
openTelemetryBuild {
    endpoint = "http://localhost:4317"
    
    traceViewType = com.atkinsondev.opentelemetry.build.TraceViewType.JAEGER
    traceViewUrl = "http://localhost:16686/"
}
```

## Usage

### Add plugin

To start using the plugin, first add the plugin to the `plugins` block in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.atkinsondev.opentelemetry-build' version "4.6.0"
}
```

Please see the Gradle plugin portal for the latest version of the plugin: https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.atkinsondev.opentelemetry-build

### Configure plugin

Then add a `openTelemetryBuild` block to your `build.gradle` file.

The only required configuration parameter is the server endpoint to send the OpenTelemetry data to.

```groovy
openTelemetryBuild {
    endpoint = "https://<opentelemetry-server-domain>"
}
```

You can also add a map of headers to the data send to the OpenTelemetry server. Adding headers can be useful for passing things like an API key for authentication:

```groovy
openTelemetryBuild {
    endpoint = "https://<opentelemetry-server-domain>"
    headers = ["X-API-Key": "<my-api-key>"]
}
```

### Zipkin Exporter configuration

In addition to the standard gRPC or HTTP OpenTelemetry exporters, the plugin supports exporting to Zipkin.

To export to Zipkin, set the `exporterMode` plugin configuration parameter to `OpenTelemetryExporterMode.ZIPKIN` and set the `endpoint` to be your Zipkin server API endpoint, similar to the following:

```groovy
openTelemetryBuild {
    endpoint = "https://yourzipkinserver.com/api/v2/spans"
    serviceName = "appname-build"
    exporterMode = com.atkinsondev.opentelemetry.build.OpenTelemetryExporterMode.ZIPKIN
}
```

### Pass trace and span IDs to `Exec` tasks as environment variables

Starting in plugin version `3.1.0` you can configure the plugin to pass the trace ID and span ID for the build
as environment variables to all `Exec` tasks in the build.
This can be helpful if you are executing commands that can support their own OpenTelemetry spans and you want
to integrate the spans from those commands with the main trace for your build.

Set the configuration parameter `taskTraceEnvironmentEnabled = true` to enable these environment variables:

```groovy
openTelemetryBuild {
    endpoint = "https://<opentelemetry-server-domain>"

    taskTraceEnvironmentEnabled = true
}
```

The environment variables are named `TRACE_ID`, `SPAN_ID`, and `TRACEPARENT` by default.

You can also customize those environment variable names with additional configuration parameters:

```groovy
openTelemetryBuild {
    endpoint = "https://<opentelemetry-server-domain>"

    taskTraceEnvironmentEnabled = true
    taskTraceEnvironmentTraceIdName = "MY_TRACE_ID"
    taskTraceEnvironmentSpanIdName = "MY_SPAN_ID"
  taskTraceEnvironmentTraceParentName = "MY_TRACEPARENT"
}
```

Put `{traceId}` in the URL for the location where the trace ID should be substituted, e.g. `http://localhost:16686/trace/{traceId}`.

** _Required_

## Compatibility

The plugin is compatible with Java 21+ and Gradle versions `8.4` and higher.

### Limitations

#### Gradle configuration cache

There is experimental support for using this plugin with the [Gradle configuration cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html).

To use the plugin with the configuration cache:

* With Gradle >=8.5 the plugin will auto-detect if the configuration cache is enabled
* With Gradle <8.5 set the plugin parameter `supportConfigCache = true`

Due to the fundamental plugin changes required to work with the configuration cache, not all span attributes are supported when the configuration cache is in use.

| Unsupported span attribute | Description                                                                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `task.type`                | Full package and class name of the task, e.g. `org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test` |
| `task.did_work`            | Whether the task did work (boolean)                                               |

Similarly, there are span attributes that are only supported when the configuration cache is in use.

| Configuration cache only span attribute | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `task.execution_reasons`                | Comma separated list of reasons why the task was executed, if the task was not `SKIPPED`, `UP-TO-DATE`, or `FROM-CACHE`.                                                                                                      |
| `task.is_incremental`                   | Whether the task was executed [incrementally](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_tasks.html#sec:implementing_an_incremental_task), if the task was executed (ie. not `SKIPPED`, `UP-TO-DATE`, or `FROM-CACHE`). |

##### Trace and span ID environment variables

Passing trace and span ID environment variables to `Exec` tasks does not work when the configuration cache is enabled.

## Examples

### Jaeger

Example of running a Jaeger instance locally and publishing build traces to it:

Run Jaeger via Docker and enable the OpenTelemetry collector with `COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true`:

```
docker run --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.64.0
```

The current version of the Jaeger Docker image is available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/jaegertracing/all-in-one/tags

Configure the plugin in `build.gradle` to point at the gRPC endpoint running on port `4317` in the local Jaeger instance:

```groovy
plugins {
  id 'com.atkinsondev.opentelemetry-build' version "4.6.0"
}

openTelemetryBuild {
    endpoint = "http://localhost:4317"
}
```

Then to view the build traces in your local Jaeger instance:

1. Go to the Jaeger UI that is running on http://localhost:16686
2. Select the service "gradle-builds"
3. Click "Find Traces"
4. Select one of the traces
